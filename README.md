# Prisma

### Making changes
After any change, just run this. It should generate a migration and push to cloud
```bash
$ prisma migrate dev --name added_job_title
```

### Validating
```bash
$ yarn prisma validate
```

# LAST TIME...

Added holes

- validation isn't working 
  - how to key into formik values to validate array items? what should id be?

After that's fixed
- save course
